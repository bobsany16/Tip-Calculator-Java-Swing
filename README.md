# Tip-Calculator-Java-Swing
This app experiments with building a User Interface for Tip Calculator application implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern in Java. 

## User Story: 
As a user, I want to be able to input an amount of money, my prefferred tip percentage, my rounding (to the nearest 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0) option, and click 'Calculate' to calculate my tip for me.
There, I expect to see my rounded tip amount along with the actual tip percentage I had made depending on my rounding option. Finally, I would be able to enter this tip amount into my bill.

## Class Diagram: 
Below is the class diagram for the architecture of the Tip Calculator application.

## Demo: 
Below is the GUI I developed using Java.Swing. This version was then updated by using JavaFX 2.0
